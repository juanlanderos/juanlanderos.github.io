    <p>Being as this is my <strong>first</strong> HTML page, it feels necessary
       to talk about how I chose my major. Long story short, it was
       a total <strong> accident </strong>. But 5 years later, here I am. If all goes well, I'll have 
       my degree by the end of the year. <strong>Fingers crossed.</strong>
